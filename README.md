## Biglesp's pyparrot installer
Not for general use yet, more something to help me install this quickly and get the drones flying.

Use findmydrone to get the Bluetooth MAC address and then add them into the MamboNo5.py file

Built using [pyparrot from Dr Amy McGovern, great tool that works so well!](https://pyparrot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
